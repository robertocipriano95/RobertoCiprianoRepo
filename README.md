# Hello, world! Or CSC256...

# I am a programming and development student with so much work that I am practically drowning. Send the coast guard, please!

# I was born and raised in Palermo, Italy until 10 years old, and up until moving to Raleigh 2 years ago, lived in NYC. I am excited to see where this journey takes me!
